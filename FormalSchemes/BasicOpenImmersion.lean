# Towards the open immersion property of the affine basic-open chart

For an adic ring `(R, I)` with `I.FG` and `f : R`, the affine basic-open chart
`Spf R{1/f} ⟶ Spf R` (`FormalSchemes/BasicOpenChart.lean`) is expected to be a
`LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion`. The underlying map is an open topological embedding with
range `D(f)` (`FormalSpectrum.isOpenEmbedding_basicOpenChartBase`,
`FormalSpectrum.range_basicOpenChartBase`); the remaining ingredient is the `c_iso` field, i.e.
the sheaf component of the chart is an isomorphism on the basis of basic opens `D(g) ⊆ D(f)`.

This file packages the chart as a named morphism and develops the **level-`n` (`evalₐ`) behaviour
of its ring-level `c`-component** — the completed-localization isomorphism
`FormalSpectrum.awayCompletionChartEquiv` (`R{1/g} ≃+* R{1/f}{1/ḡ}`,
`FormalSchemes/AwayCompletionInterchange.lean`) — read level by level. This is the reusable
algebraic core of the `c_iso`-on-basis route towards `LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion`.

The key observation is that all the completed maps in play are built from
`AdicCompletion.mapCompletion`, whose level-`n` component is the induced map of quotients
(`evalₐ_mapCompletion`). Chaining this along the two factors of `awayCompletionChartEquiv`
(the localization transitivity `awayAwayLocEquiv` and the interchange `interchangeForward`)
computes `evalₐ n (awayCompletionChartEquiv …)` as a composite of two `Ideal.quotientMap`s.

## Main results

* `AdicCompletion.evalₐ_mapCompletion`: the general functoriality rule
  `evalₐ n (mapCompletion f x) = Ideal.quotientMap (J ^ n) f _ (evalₐ n x)`; the level-`n`
  component of a completed ring map is the induced map of quotients. Reusable throughout the
  `AdicCompletion` development.
* `FormalSpectrum.basicOpenChart`: the affine basic-open chart `Spf R{1/f} ⟶ Spf R`, packaged as a
  morphism of locally ringed spaces.
* `FormalSpectrum.isUnit_algebraMap_away_left`: the containment↔unit bridge — `f` is a unit in
  `Localization.Away (f * g)`, so each basic open `D(f * g) = D(f) ⊓ D(g) ≤ D(f)` (these form a
  basis of `D(f)`) carries the interchange hypothesis of `awayCompletionChartEquiv`.
* `AdicCompletion.evalₐ_interchangeForward`, `FormalSpectrum.evalₐ_awayCompletionAwayEquiv`,
  `FormalSpectrum.evalₐ_awayCompletionChartEquiv`: the level-`n` components of the interchange
  forward map, the localization-transitivity isomorphism, and their composite the chart's
  `c`-component, each as an `Ideal.quotientMap`.

## Remaining follow-up (issue 163 sheaf-level `c_iso`)

The full `LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion` still needs the **sheaf-side matching**: identify the
chart's sheaf component on a basic open `D(g) ⊆ D(f)` — read through
`FormalSpectrum.sectionsBasicOpenEquiv` on both sides (target open via `map_preimage_basicOpen`) —
with `awayCompletionChartEquiv`, by `AdicCompletion.ext_evalₐ`, matching at each level `n` the
`basicOpenLevelEquiv`-conjugation of `levelSheafHom`/`comap (levelRingHom …)` (via
`mapSheafHom_hom_app_pi` + `eval_sectionsBasicOpenEquiv` in `BasicOpenChartComponent.lean`)
against the composite quotient map computed here (`evalₐ_awayCompletionChartEquiv`). After that,
`TopCat.Sheaf.isIso_iff_isIso_basis` on the basis of basic opens below `D(f)` (using
`isUnit_algebraMap_away_left` for the covering opens `D(f * g)`) upgrades `basicOpenChart` to a
`PresheafedSpace.IsOpenImmersion`, then `SheafedSpace`/`LocallyRingedSpace` packaging with range
`basicOpen I f` (`range_basicOpenChartBase`).
