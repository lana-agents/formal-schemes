# Affine formal spectra are separated over the base

For a base adic ring `(R, I)` (with `I` finitely generated) and a complete adic `R`-algebra `A`
whose ideal of definition is the extension `I·A`, the diagonal morphism

```
Δ_{A/R} : Spf A ⟶ Spf (A ⊗̂_R A)
```

of the affine fibre product `Spf A ×_{Spf R} Spf A` (`FormalSchemes.AffineDiagonal`, EGA I 10.15)
is a **section of both projections**, so it is a *split monomorphism* and in particular a
**monomorphism**. This is the categorical statement that the affine formal spectrum `Spf A` is
**separated over `Spf R`**.

At the ring level the diagonal is `Spf` of the **codiagonal** (multiplication) map

```
∇ : A ⊗̂_R A →+* A,   a ⊗ b ↦ a · b,
```

which is **surjective** (it splits the canonical map `inl : A → A ⊗̂_R A`). Surjectivity of the
codiagonal is the ring-level input to the sharper statement that `Δ_{A/R}` is a *closed* immersion
(EGA I 10.15): a formal spectrum is separated over the base iff its diagonal is a closed immersion,
and the affine diagonal is cut out by the kernel of the surjection `∇`.

## Main definitions and results

* `CompletedTensorProduct.codiagonal`: the multiplication map `A ⊗̂_R A →+* A`.
* `CompletedTensorProduct.codiagonal_surjective`: the codiagonal is surjective.
* `CompletedTensorProduct.isSplitMono_diagonal`: the diagonal `Δ_{A/R}` is a split monomorphism.
* `CompletedTensorProduct.mono_diagonal`: the diagonal `Δ_{A/R}` is a monomorphism — the affine
  formal spectrum `Spf A` is separated over `Spf R`.

**Scope.** This delivers the categorical *separatedness* content (the diagonal is a monomorphism)
and the ring-level surjectivity of the codiagonal. Upgrading `Δ_{A/R}` to a genuine *closed
immersion of locally ringed spaces* — the full EGA I 10.15 statement — needs the surjective-`c`-
component / sheaf-level closed-immersion infrastructure (the sheaf-level task also flagged for
EGA I §10.14, cf. issue 163's `c_iso` work), recorded as a follow-up. The general separatedness of a
non-affine `X ⟶ Y` needs the fibre product of general formal schemes over the affine cover
(`FormalScheme.OpenCover`, issue 191).
