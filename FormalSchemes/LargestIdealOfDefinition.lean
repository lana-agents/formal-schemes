# The largest ideal of definition of a Noetherian adic ring

An *ideal of definition* of a topological ring `R` is an ideal `I` for which the topology on `R`
is the `I`-adic one (`IsAdic I`). Such an ideal is far from unique, but the collection of ideals
of definition is well controlled: they all have the same radical (`IsAdic.radical_eq`, from
`FormalSchemes.IdealsOfDefinition`), and this common radical is the *largest* ideal of definition
whenever `R` is Noetherian. Geometrically this is the statement that the reduced closed subscheme
underlying `Spf R` is intrinsic, EGA I, §10.3, in particular 10.3.6.

## Main results

* `IsAdic.of_le_of_pow_le`: two cofinal ideals define the same adic topology — if `I` is an ideal
  of definition, `I ≤ J`, and some power `J ^ n ≤ I`, then `J` is again an ideal of definition.
  This is the elementary comparison underlying everything below.
* `IsAdic.isTopologicallyNilpotent_iff_mem_radical`: an element of an adic ring is topologically
  nilpotent (its powers converge to `0`) iff it lies in the radical of an ideal of definition. No
  finiteness hypothesis is needed.
* `IsAdic.topologicalNilradical_eq_radical`: consequently the `topologicalNilradical` of `R` (the
  ideal of topologically nilpotent elements) equals the radical of any ideal of definition.
* `IsAdic.isAdic_radical`: for a Noetherian adic ring, the radical of an ideal of definition is
  itself an ideal of definition.
* `IsAdic.isGreatest_radical` / `IsAdic.isAdic_topologicalNilradical`: for a Noetherian adic ring,
  the radical of an ideal of definition — equivalently the ideal of topologically nilpotent
  elements — is the *largest* ideal of definition (EGA I 10.3.6).

/-- An element of an adic ring is topologically nilpotent — its powers converge to `0` — precisely
when it lies in the radical of an ideal of definition `I`. One direction is that `I` is a
neighbourhood of `0`; the other uses that if `a ^ k ∈ I` then `a ^ m ∈ I ^ p` for all large `m`,
and the powers `I ^ p` form a basis of neighbourhoods of `0`. No finiteness hypothesis is
